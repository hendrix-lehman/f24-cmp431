# Project 2

## Introduction

In this project, we are going to use the NYC Open Data API to get [Jobs Posting data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Jobs-NYC-Postings/kpav-sd4t/about_data). We will use the data to list every job posting that is currently available in the NYC Open Data API. 

## Data

The data is available in the NYC Open Data API. The data is available in JSON format. See link above.

## The App

### Home Page
The app will list all job posting including agency, business title, number of positions, salary range.


### Job Posting Page
When a user clicks on a job posting, the app will display more details about the job posting including job description, minimum qualifications, preferred skills, and additional information.
